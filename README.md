# Income-prediction-model
# Description:
An income prediction model estimates a personâ€™s income based on features such as age, education, occupation, and work hours. This can be used for socioeconomic analysis or targeted marketing. In this project, we build a regression model using scikit-learn to predict annual income based on synthetic data.

# ðŸ’° What This Project Demonstrates:
* Uses regression modeling to predict income from demographic/work data

* Encodes categorical features and standardizes input

* Evaluates performance with MSE and RÂ², and visualizes results
